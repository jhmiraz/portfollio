        Welcome to My Portfolio! Hey there! I'm thrilled to welcome you to my
        corner of the web. I'm currently a dedicated student at Daffodil
        International University, where I'm pursuing my passion for computer
        science. With a current CGPA of 3.54, I'm constantly striving for
        excellence in my academic journey. Beyond academics, I'm a multifaceted
        individual with a love for various activities. When I'm not buried in
        textbooks or coding away, you'll often find me indulging in my favorite
        pastimes. I'm an avid gamer, always ready for a thrilling adventure in
        virtual worlds. Additionally, I'm passionate about fitness and spend my
        free time working out to stay energized and focused. One of my greatest
        joys is writing code. Whether it's crafting elegant algorithms or
        developing innovative solutions, I find immense satisfaction in the art
        of programming. From tackling challenging problems to building exciting
        projects, coding is where I thrive. My academic achievements reflect my
        dedication and perseverance. I proudly secured a GPA of 5 in my Higher
        Secondary Certificate (HSC) exams and continued to excel with a GPA of
        3.67 in my Secondary School Certificate (SSC) exams. This portfolio is a
        reflection of my journey, showcasing my skills, projects, and
        experiences. Join me as I navigate the exciting world of technology and
        beyond!
